## Welcome to [Jyron's Portfolio]()

I am a front and back-end developer who uses Python, Javascript, Sql, and MongoDb to create interactive websites, web scrapers, datasets, and custom Apis.

## My latest projects include:

### [World Writers Club](http://www.worldwritersclub.com/)
A front-end powered by Css Keyframe animations, and a back-end powered by Python/Flask/Postgres
This site allows writers to submit writings based on our list of prompts, and save them to a public or private collection.

### [Here! News! Now!](https://herenewsnow.herokuapp.com/)
A front-end powered by Jade/Pug Templating engine, and a back-end powered by Express/Node.Js.
This site features an integration with News Api to present top headlines from around the world, users can choose whichever subject interests them.

### [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/jyronw/us-state-of-the-union-addresses-1790-2019)
This dataset contains a transcript of every U.S Presidential State Of The Union, from 1790-2019.  It's been downloaded and used for research 30+ times!  It was created using Python and CSV file formatter, with the original intention being NLP research.

## Jobs

I work largely in Python, Node.Js, and SQL/NoSQL to create back-end services.  In addition I have extensive experience with TCP/IP packet analysis and Linux OS configuration and customization.

## Pet Project

Since having my Mac stolen in __August 2019__ I have made it a point to repurpose old pcs and laptops with lightweight, usable linux distros (ubuntu, openSuse, etc) and donate them to students who want to learn coding.  If you would like to help donate laptops to aspiring student coders, contact me.
