## Welcome to [Jyron's Developer Portfolio]()

I am a front and back-end developer who uses Python, Javascript, Sql, and MongoDb to create interactive websites, web scrapers, datasets, and custom Apis.

## My latest projects include:

### [WorldWriterClub](http://www.worldwritersclub.com/)
A front-end powered by Css Keyframe animations, and a backend powered by Python/Flask/Postgres
This site allows writers to submit writings based on our list of prompts, and save them to a public or private collection.

### [Here! News! Now!](https://herenewsnow.herokuapp.com/)
A front-end powered by Jade/Pug Templating engine, and a back-end powered by Express/Node.Js.
This site features an integration with News Api to present top headlines from around the world.

### [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/jyronw/us-state-of-the-union-addresses-1790-2019)
This dataset contains a transcript of every U.S Presidential State Of The Union, from 1790-2019.  It's been downloaded and used for research 30+ times!  It was created using Python and CSV file formatter, with the original intention being NLP research.
