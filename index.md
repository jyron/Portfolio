## Welcome to [Jyron's Developer Portfolio](https://jyron.github.io/Portfolio/)

I am a front and back-end developer who uses Python, Javascript, Sql, and MongoDb to create interactive websites and programs.

## My latest projects include

### [WorldWriterClub](http://www.worldwritersclub.com/)
A front-end powered by Css Keyframe animations, and a backend powered by Python/Flask/Postgres
This site allows writers to submit writings based on our list of prompts, and save them to a public or private collection.

### [Here!News!Now!](https://herenewsnow.herokuapp.com/)
A front-end powered by Jade/Pug Templating engine, and a back-end powered by Express/Node.Js.
This site features an integration with News Api to present top headlines from around the world.  


### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jyron/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
