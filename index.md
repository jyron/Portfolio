## Welcome to [Jyron's Portfolio]()

I am a backend developer who uses Python, Javascript, Sql, and MongoDb to create interactive websites, web scrapers, datasets, and custom Apis.  I'm happy to work with cloud databases, distributed systems, and large datasets and datastreaming services.

## My latest projects include:

### [World Writers Club](http://www.worldwritersclub.com/)
A front-end powered by Css Keyframe animations, and a back-end powered by Python/Flask/Postgres
This site allows writers to submit writings based on our list of prompts, and save them to a public or private collection.

### [Here! News! Now!](https://herenewsnow.herokuapp.com/)
A front-end powered by Jade/Pug Templating engine, and a back-end powered by Express/Node.Js.
This site features an integration with News Api to present top headlines from around the world, users can choose whichever subject interests them.

### WikiScraper
###### This is one of my favorite projects! But Jekyll causes link issues... Please view the WikiScrape repo in my Github.
This is a tool you can use to teach yourself about a variety of subjects, including endangered animals and U.S state histories.  It uses python/http requests to scrape data from several different websites and present info to you through a cli.  The click and choose format is very kid friendly, as are the giant images of cute animals that pop up when you use the service.  To get started, create a python virtual environment and follow the instructions in the repo.  

### [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/jyronw/us-state-of-the-union-addresses-1790-2019)
This dataset contains a transcript of every U.S Presidential State Of The Union, from 1790-2019.  It's been downloaded and used for research 30+ times!  It was created using Python and CSV file formatter, with the original intention being NLP research.

### [Vue Ecommerce Store](https://stark-beach-20488.herokuapp.com/)
This is a dynamic ecommerce store that updates its product line based on the weather of the city you search.  It uses the Open Weather Api alongside Vue Js to create a single page app that updates in realtime.  Try the link out!
ps. We only sell ski clothes :)

## Project

Since having my Mac stolen in __August 2018__ I have taken time to repurpose old pcs and laptops with lightweight, usable linux distros (Ubuntu, openSuse, etc) and donate them to students who want to learn coding.  If you would like to help donate laptops to aspiring student coders, contact me!
